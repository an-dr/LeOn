# LeOn

A simple robot-companion for my cat. Main project features:

1. **Architecture-oriented**
    - Develop the right architecture using architectural best practices
2. **Result-oriented and minimalistic**
    - Progress over perfection
3. **Integration-oriented**.
    - Reusing existing libraries, projects, etc. Minimum development of individual pieces
4. **Reusable in my other projects**
    - It should be done automatically with a good architecture. But I want to make several special decisions to make the project easy to transfer to my another robotic project.
