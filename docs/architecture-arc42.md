## Introduction and Goals

This project is an effort of establishing a development workflow via practical product development.

There are two main requirements for the project:

- The product should be a working and entertaining for a cat autonomous toy.
- Components, processes and libraries of the project must be developed to be reusable in other projects.

The project is based on the following principles:

1. **Architecture-oriented**
    - Develop the right architecture using architectural best practices
2. **Result-oriented and minimalistic**
    - Progress over perfection
3. **Integration-oriented**
    - Reusing existing libraries, projects, etc. Minimum development of individual pieces
4. **Reusable in my other projects**
    - It should be done automatically with a good architecture. But I want to make several special decisions to make the project easy to transfer to my another robotic project.

### Quality Goals

| No | Quality                  | Motivation                                                                                      |
|----|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Cat Friendliness         | The product should be interesting and attractive for a cat                                      |
| 2  | Safety                   | The product should be safe for pets, it should not harm the pet in any way                      |
| 3  | Devellopment Reusability | The project components should be easy to reuse in other projects. Especially in my ouw projects |

### Stakeholders

| Role/Name                              | Expectations                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cats (especially Bastet)               | The cats should get a simple funny toy that is able to entertain them                                                       |
| Developers                             | Developers must get an polished transparent quality product that can be reused or valuable from the education point of view |
| Andrei Gramakov                        | I suppose to do two things at once: 1. improve my architect skills, 2. move my another enormously big robotic project.      |
| Potential employers of Andrei Gramakov | Should get an allustrative entry in my portfolio to better understand my skills and experience.                             |

## Architecture Constraints

Software:

- Should follow the Clean Architecture principles
- Should be modular and reusable
- Hardware details should go to the thin last layer
- Most of the development should be done platform-independent.
- Movement logic should be easy detachable of the application logic - to be able to use it in other projects

Hardware:

- Motors must be quite

## System Scope and Context

### Business Context

The business context is represented by a diagram with all counterparts interacting with the system.

Communication partners:

- Cat
- Cat owner
- Developers

![business_ctx](architecture-arc42/business_ctx.drawio.svg)


### Technical Context

The technical context is represented by a UML deployment diagram.

![deployment](architecture-arc42/deployment.drawio.svg)

## Solution Strategy

### 1. Physical Transportation System is a separate physical component

**Solution approach**. The System can be considered as a separate device accepting commands from the main controller via a CANbus protocol.

### 2. Physical Transportation System is an independent and unit-tested piece of software. The rest of the system is tested via integration or black-box tests

**Solution approach**. It has a separate location with it's own file structure - src, include, test, etc. Unit testing is done only for the Physical Transportation System.

### 3. Cat Interaction Logic is isolated from the main app

**Solution approach**. Cat Interaction Logic interacts with the main app via an abstract interface. The logic itself is enclosed in an entity, and interacts with the physical components also via an abstract interface.

### 4. Besides the drivers, all components are platform-independent

**Solution approach**. Each components besides the applications should be a separate library.

### 5. Most of the development is done without involving the hardware

**Solution approach**. Drivers should have an abstract interface, and the should have fake implementation of it for the development environment (e.g. a desktop OS).

# Building Block View

## Level 1 - White Box: Overall System

The decomposition of the system splits the system in three subsystems:

![block_view_0](architecture-arc42/block_view_0.drawio.svg)

Each subsystem represents a separate physical module of the system.

## Level 2

### White Box: Main Controller

![ibd_mc](architecture-arc42/ibd_mc.drawio.svg)

### White Box: Physical Transportation System

![ibd_pts](architecture-arc42/ibd_pts.drawio.svg)

### White Box: Cat Interaction Mechanism

![ibd_cim](architecture-arc42/ibd_cim.drawio.svg)

### White Box: Power System

![ibd_cim](architecture-arc42/ibd_ps.drawio.svg)

## Level 3

Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from
level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.

### White Box \<\_building block x.1\_\>

Specifies the internal structure of *building block x.1*.

# Runtime View

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the
system’s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

-   important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute
    them?

-   interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks
    cooperate with users and neighboring systems?

-   operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop

-   error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios
(sequences, workflows) is their **architectural relevance**. It is
**not** important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should
rather document a representative selection.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system
perform their job and communicate at runtime. You will mainly capture
scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to
stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the
static models (building block view, deployment view).

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

-   numbered list of steps (in natural language)

-   activity diagrams or flow charts

-   sequence diagrams

-   BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)

-   state machines

-   …

See [Runtime View](https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/) in the arc42
documentation.

## \<Runtime Scenario 1>

-   *\<insert runtime diagram or textual description of the scenario>*

-   *\<insert description of the notable aspects of the interactions
    between the building block instances depicted in this diagram.>*

## \<Runtime Scenario 2>

## …

## \<Runtime Scenario n>

# Deployment View

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

The deployment view describes:

1.  technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with
    infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments,
    computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other
    infrastructure elements and

2.  mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure
    elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development
environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you
should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as
distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or
container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors
and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those
elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of
your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and
describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Software does not run without hardware. This underlying infrastructure
can and will influence a system and/or some cross-cutting concepts.
Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section
3.2. as technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box.
In this section one can zoom into this black box using additional
deployment diagrams:

-   UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it,
    probably with nested diagrams, when your infrastructure is more
    complex.

-   When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams
    rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able
    to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

See [Deployment View](https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/) in the arc42
documentation.

## Infrastructure Level 1

Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

-   distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments,
    computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between
    them

-   important justifications or motivations for this deployment
    structure

-   quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure

-   mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and
adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.

# Cross-cutting Concepts

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas
that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. They can
include many different topics, such as

-   models, especially domain models

-   architecture or design patterns

-   rules for using specific technology

-   principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (=
    cross-cutting) nature

-   implementation rules

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Concepts form the basis for *conceptual integrity* (consistency,
homogeneity) of the architecture. Thus, they are an important
contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks,
e.g. security or safety.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

The form can be varied:

-   concept papers with any kind of structure

-   cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the
    architecture views

-   sample implementations, especially for technical concepts

-   reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using
    Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Structure**

</div>

A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

-   Domain concepts

-   User Experience concepts (UX)

-   Safety and security concepts

-   Architecture and design patterns

-   "Under-the-hood"

-   development concepts

-   operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one
specific topic on this list.

![Possible topics for crosscutting
concepts](images/08-Crosscutting-Concepts-Structure-EN.png)

See [Concepts](https://docs.arc42.org/section-8/) in the arc42
documentation.

*\<explanation>*

## *\<Concept 2>*

## *\<Concept n>*

*\<explanation>*

# Architecture Decisions

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions
including rationales. With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative
based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision
should be documented here in this central section or whether you better
document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building
block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the
most important decisions of your architecture.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace
your decisions.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

Various options:

-   ADR ([Documenting Architecture
    Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions))
    for every important decision

-   List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:

-   more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

See [Architecture Decisions](https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/) in the
arc42 documentation. There you will find links and examples about ADR.

# Quality Requirements

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with
scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in
section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important
to them, concrete and measurable.

See [Quality Requirements](https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/) in the
arc42 documentation.

## Quality Tree

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis
Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes
large number of quality requirements.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and
requirements:

-   tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or
    "usefulness" as a root

-   a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the
following section.

## Quality Scenarios

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements
using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at
the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

-   Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case
    scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain
    stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s
    efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s
    request within one second.

-   Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its
    immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is
    implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily
measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2) more
precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and
evaluated.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

Tabular or free form text.

# Risks and Technical Debts

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by
priority

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of
risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by
management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested
measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

See [Risks and Technical Debt](https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/) in
the arc42 documentation.

# Glossary

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use
when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in
multi-language teams.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

-   have an identical understanding of these terms

-   do not use synonyms and homonyms

A table with columns \<Term> and \<Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

See [Glossary](https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/) in the arc42
documentation.

| Term        | Definition        |
|-------------|-------------------|
| *\<Term-1>* | *\<definition-1>* |
| *\<Term-2>* | *\<definition-2>* |
